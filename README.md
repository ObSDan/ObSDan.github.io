## Welcome to my new blog

Hello, I am Daniel Cleaton - previously the founder of ObSkewer Games and currently the QA Manager at YoYo Games, developers of the popular GameMaker Studio software with which you can create your own games and get them onto stores so people can play/buy them.

*Note that even though I say about GameMaker in my introduction to give context about who I am, this blog is not intended to be a GameMaker blog or anything to do with my day job, so please don't follow this blog or contact me here if you're looking for GMS2 stuff - although, I may from time-to-time post the odd snippet or dev diary for something game-related I am working on.*

Instead, I am going to use this blog primarily as a way of documenting my own research into deep learning (and later, into more general machine learning and dev diaries for the cool little projects I hope to make with all this knowledge).

I am currently learning how to use the **Fast.ai** framework with **PyTorch** in order to figure out deep learning, play around with some new skills, and generally have some fun along the way.

And I should say just now that it's thanks to Fast.ai that I have created this new GitHub Pages blog today, using [their fantastic guide](https://www.fast.ai/2020/01/16/fast_template/) to taking the same tools I now use for doing my deep learning and making them do double duty as my blog-authoring software also. In this way, I hope to have posts showing the behind-the-scenes detail of the work I am doing and the actual results I am getting at the time.

If you're interested in deep learning and haven't tried Fast.ai, then you can find out more info on this *completely free*, easy-to-learn and extremely powerful library at [their main website](https://www.fast.ai). You can check out their free [2020 video course](https://course.fast.ai), and their free [book to accompany/expand upon the videos](https://github.com/fastai/fastbook). Note if you wish to save your eyesight and spend some time away from your screen, you can also buy a physical or Kindle copy of the book off various bookstores and Amazon (as I have done).

Okay, welcomes/thanks/advertisments out of the way, it's on with the blog...!
