I am Daniel Cleaton, a fairly long-term veteran of the Scottish game development "scene": having worked in game QA at several Dundee and Edinburgh studios a number of years ago; being a mature student graduate of the University of Abertay, Dundee's *Game Production Management* degree; being the founder of the now-defunct ObSkewer Games and having a stab at releasing my own games on *Xbox Creators Club* back in the *XNA* days; and other gamedev-related jaunts along the way. I am currently the QA Manager at YoYo Games, where I have been for the last 10 years-ish.

However, I have only been dabbling in deep learning using Fast.ai for about 18 months - although, there was a whopping gap in the middle of this while I waited for v2 to be released and become mature before restarting/diving in properly to fill up the free evening times that Covid brought to my world. Realistically, since early March 2021, but with a bit of messing about and understanding of the basics before that.

So... I am going to use this blog primarily as a way of documenting my own research into deep learning (and later, into more general machine learning and dev diaries for the cool little projects I hope to make with all this knowledge).

I hope you enjoy my content and find at least bits of it educational. Maybe even inspirational.


## Fast.ai

I am currently learning how to use the **Fast.ai** framework with **PyTorch** in order to figure out deep learning, play around with some new skills, and generally have some fun along the way.

And I should say just now that it's thanks to Fast.ai that I have created this new GitHub Pages blog today, using [their fantastic guide](https://www.fast.ai/2020/01/16/fast_template/) to taking the same tools I now use for doing my deep learning and making them do double duty as my blog-authoring software also. In this way, I hope to have posts showing the behind-the-scenes detail of the work I am doing and the actual results I am getting at the time.

If you're interested in deep learning and haven't tried Fast.ai, then you can find out more info on this *completely free*, easy-to-learn and extremely powerful library at [their main website](https://www.fast.ai). You can check out their free [2020 video course](https://course.fast.ai), and their free [book to accompany/expand upon the videos](https://github.com/fastai/fastbook). Note if you wish to save your eyesight and spend some time away from your screen, you can also buy a physical or Kindle copy of the book off various bookstores and Amazon (as I have done).


## GameMaker Studio 2

YoYo are the developers of the popular [GameMaker Studio](https://www.yoyogames.com/get) software with which you can create your own games and get them onto stores so people can play/buy them. Feel free to check that out if you're into making your own games or fancy giving it a go.

*Note that even though I say about GameMaker in my introduction to give context about who I am, this blog is not intended to be a GameMaker blog or anything to do with my day job, so please don't follow this blog or contact me here if you're looking for GMS2 stuff - although, I may from time-to-time post the odd snippet or dev diary for something game-related I am working on.*
